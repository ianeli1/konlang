# Kon Language

A basic programming language. More of a experiment to learn how they work.

## What I want to achieve

I want it to be simple to get used to, interpreted and weak typed. A mix between JS and Python, but the creator has no clue how to make a good language.

There's two types: string and number

```
let variableName = "asda" //creates a string
//only let exists, all variables are mutable

print(variableName) //logs it to the console, if existing

```

The idea is to make a compiler for Senkomputer in the future.

```
//declaration
let i = 0

//reassignation
i = 1

//method call
print(i)

//method definition
define nameOfMethod(){
    stuff
}

```
